Changes from SCBv3.2 to SCBv3.3
===============================

SCB_PLLs:

2.- Connectors:
CN1 Ethernet connector case connected to GND_SHIELD.
3.- CPU_100M_Ethernet:
C206 changed from 470pF to 2,7nF in order to remove this component and reduce boom.
Added R253 and R254 resistors (both 75R) between the Tr1 and C214.
L10 is not mounted now. It connects GND_SHIELD and GND_ETH.
4.- QDRII_mem and QDRII_power: 
All the components of the QDRII memories will be not mounted. 




Changes from SCBv3.1 to SCBv3.2
===============================

12.-  RS232_and_USB:
RS232 R1out divider changed to 100/330R


Changes from SCBv3.0 to SCBv3.1
===============================

Schematics:

1.- Connectors:
	FPGA JTAG connector, TDI and TDO swapped.
	FPGA JTAG Header changed to 0878321421  Molex. 
	P2 Header changed by a 2mm SMD version.
	Added FPGA fan connector P9.
	Changed USB schematics ports for CPU_USB harness. 
	Order of SMC signal changed in order to group inputs and outputs on PCB.
2.- CPU_DDR2
	Error in ARM EBI0 symbol. RAS and CAS pins are swapped.
	Signals DDR_DQM0 and DDR_DQM1 to DDR are swapped.
	Signals name updated by pin swapping in serial resistors.
3.- SMI_Link_7-12:
	Swapped P/N lines in some differential pairs in order to fix error introduced by the pin swapping process during the PCB routing.
4.- uTCA_Tongue3:
	Swapped P/N lines in some differential pairs in order to fix error introduced by the pin swapping process during the PCB routing.
5.- SCB_PLLs:
	Added pull-down resistor to RESET and PD AD9516 pins. Both pins are connected together. 
	Added pull-resistor to EN pin of IC12 (clock driver). This pin is now controlled by FPGA.
	This changes are for improving power consumption when both chips (IC16 and IC12) are 	not been used. 
	RSTN Pin of IC13 connected to +3V3 to allow this chips work when AD9516 is reset.
6.- Power_Supply:
	Diode D16 PN changed for S2M-TP
7.- RS232_and_USB_ports
	Changed USB schematics ports for CPU_USB harness. 
8.- FPGA_Peripherals_Control
