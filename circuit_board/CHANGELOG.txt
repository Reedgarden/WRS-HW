MCH_MAIN:

(add fixes done after sch review....)


- reordered CPU LEDs and UTCA leds signals
- eth connector ground changed to ETH100_AGND
- added internal netlabels
- removed DCLK connection to GPIO pins (not necessary - we are using SSC)

- reordered SW_JTAG and FPGA config lines
- changed UART routing to front panel (now UART0)
- CPU reset thru diode (D22) to make JTAG working :)

- changed downlink PHY->fabric A line mapping
- changed atmega footprint to MLF64 for space reasons...
- pinswap in atmega WD chip
- changed 28c16 eeprom to ds18b20 unique id chip
- routed atmega uart to programming connector for debugging purposes
